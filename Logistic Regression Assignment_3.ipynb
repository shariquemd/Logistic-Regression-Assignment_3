    "\n",
    "Precision:\n",
    "\n",
    "Precision measures the accuracy of positive predictions.\n",

    "It indicates the proportion of predicted positive instances that are actually positive.\n",
    "Recall (Sensitivity):\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall measures the model's ability to capture all positive instances.\n",
    "Recall = TP / (TP + FN)\n",

    "Q2. What is the F1 score and how is it calculated? How is it different from precision and recall?\n",
    "\n",
    "F1 Score:\n",
    "The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall.\n",
    "F1 Score = 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)\n",

    "AUC (Area Under the ROC Curve):\n",
    "\n",
    "AUC measures the area under the ROC curve.\n",
    "AUC close to 1 indicates good model performance.\n",
    "AUC of 0.5 represents a random classifier.\n",
    "Q4. How do you choose the best metric to evaluate the performance of a classification model?\n",
